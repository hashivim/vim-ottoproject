# vim-ottoproject

This plugin adds a `:Otto` command that runs [otto](http://ottoproject.io),
with tab completion of subcommands.

## Installation

With [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) just do:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/markcornick/vim-ottoproject.git

If you prefer to use something besides pathogen, go ahead.
